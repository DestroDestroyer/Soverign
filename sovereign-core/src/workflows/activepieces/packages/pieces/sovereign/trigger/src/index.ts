/**
 * `@sovereignpieces/piece-sovereign-trigger` -- bridges Sovereign events into workflows
 * and exposes one workflow as the input to another.
 *
 *   trigger: on_event       (polling: subscribe to a Sovereign event type)
 *   action:  run_workflow   (start another saved workflow; the user picks
 *                            the target via the editor's flow_ref widget,
 *                            value stored as the destination flow id)
 *
 * Both surfaces call back to the daemon. The trigger uses a stateless poll
 * pattern (the daemon keeps a short-lived recent-events buffer; the trigger
 * persists its `since` cursor via `context.store`).
